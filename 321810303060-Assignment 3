####1.   take 2 inputs from user and check whether they are equal or not

a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")
if a == b:
	print("Both inputs are equal")
else:
	print("Your input is not equal")
#output 1:-  Enter the first number:3
                     #Enter the second number:3
                     #Both inputs are equal
#output 2:-  Enter the first number:6
                     #Enter the second number:3
                     #Your input is not equal          
	
####2.	Take 3 inputs from user and check :
         #  all are equal
         # any of two are equal
         #( use and or )
         
print("first number")
first = input()
print("second number")
second = input()
print("third number")
third = input()
all = first == second and second == third and third == first

                    # 2
                    #All are equal: True
                    #Any of three are equal: True
#output 2:-  first number
                    # 2
                    #second number
                    # 3
                    #third number
                    # 2
                    #All are equal: False
                    #Any of three are equal: True
#output 3:-  first number
                    # 2
                    #second number
                    # 3
                    #third number
                    # 4
                    #All are equal: False
                    #Any of three are equal: False
 
####3.	Take two number and check whether the sum is greater than 5, less than 5 or equal to 5.
print("Enter first number")
first =int(input())
print("Enter second number")
second =int(input())
sum = first+second
print("Sum is greater than 5:",sum>5)
print("Sum is equal to 5:",sum==5)
print("Sum is lesser than 5:",sum<5)
#output 1:-  Enter first number
                   # 2
                   #Enter second number
                   # 3
                   #Sum is greater than 5:False
                   #Sum is equal to 5:True
                   #Sum is lesser than 5:Flase
#output 2:-  Enter first number
                   # 5
                   #Enter second number
                   # 8
                   #Sum is greater than 5:True
                   #Sum is equal to 5:False
                   #Sum is lesser than 5:Flase    
#output 3:-  Enter first number
                   # 2
                   #Enter second number
                   # 1
                   #Sum is greater than 5:False
                   #Sum is equal to 5:False
                   #Sum is lesser than 5:True
                   
####4.	Suppose passing marks of a subject is 35. Take input of marks from user and check whether it is greater than passing marks or not.

pm = 35
print("Marks obtained:")
marks =int(input())
print("Marks is greater than passing marks:", marks>pm)  
#output 1:-   Marks obtained:
	                #90
	                #Marks is greater than passing      marks: True    
#output 2:-   Marks obtained:
	                #28
	                #Marks is greater than passing      marks: False  
	                
####5.	Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))
if(num1 > num2) and (num1 > num3):
	largest = num1
elif(num2 > num1) and (num2 > num3):
	largest = num2
else:
	largest = num3
print("The largest number is:",largest)
#output:-  Enter first number:5
                #Enter second number:9
                #Enter third number:3
                #The largest number is:9
